# Python Algorithmic Challenges and Data Processing Tasks

## Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to solve various algorithmic challenges and data processing tasks. The focus is on enhancing Python proficiency through practical applications in areas such as list comprehension, object-oriented programming (OOP), and algorithm implementation.

### Key Tasks and Concepts:
1. **List Comprehension**:
   - Filtering and sorting lists based on specific conditions.
   - Removing elements at prime indices and other designated positions within lists.

2. **Multidimensional Arrays**:
   - Generating and manipulating multidimensional arrays with random values.
   - Performing operations such as matrix rotations.

3. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Implementing common algorithms such as binary search and prime number identification using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - Developing solutions for palindrome checks, finding maximum sums in subarrays, and solving the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.

4. **Data Structures**:
   - Implementing and working with various data structures, including stacks, queues, and binary trees.
   - Performing operations such as tree traversal, finding the minimum element, and simulating real-world scenarios with these structures.

### Methods and Tools:
- **Python Libraries**: `random`, `collections`, and basic Python standard libraries.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Solutions implemented using classes and objects to structure the code.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting and searching techniques.
  - Recursive algorithms for classical problems like Tower of Hanoi.
  - Prime number generation with optimized techniques like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

# Statistical Learning Project: Medical Cost Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing healthcare data to uncover insights and perform hypothesis testing on various factors influencing medical costs. The dataset includes information on individuals such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and medical charges. By exploring this data, we aim to find significant trends and differences that can help insurance companies make informed business decisions.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding the data by checking its shape, types, missing values, and performing a 5-point summary of numerical attributes.
   - Analyzing the distribution of key columns like `age`, `bmi`, and `charges`.
   - Detecting skewness and identifying outliers.
   - Visualizing the distribution of categorical columns.

2. **Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**
   - Investigating whether smokers have significantly higher medical costs compared to non-smokers.
   - Comparing BMI differences between males and females.
   - Assessing whether the proportion of smokers varies significantly between genders.
   - Testing if the distribution of BMI differs among women with varying numbers of children.

### Methods and Tools:
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - T-tests for independent samples
  - Chi-square test for categorical data
  - ANOVA for comparing multiple groups

## Steps and Workflow
1. **Importing Data and Libraries**: Load the dataset and required libraries for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform a detailed analysis to understand data distribution, outliers, and relationships.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Use statistical methods to draw conclusions about various hypotheses related to the data.
4. **Visualizations**: Create visual representations such as histograms, boxplots, pair plots, and more to support insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `insurance.csv`, which contains medical costs billed by health insurance based on individual attributes like age, BMI, and smoking habits.

## Installation
Clone this repository and ensure the following libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy
