## Python Task Descriptions

This repository contains a series of Python programs designed to tackle various algorithmic and data processing challenges using list comprehension, object-oriented programming, and more. The tasks focus on refining Python skills with practical applications, such as:

1. Filtering and sorting lists based on specific conditions using list comprehension.

2. Removing elements at prime indices and other positions in lists.

3. Generating and manipulating multidimensional arrays with random values.

4. Implementing common algorithms like matrix rotations, binary search, and prime number identification using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

5. Creating Python programs to perform tasks such as palindrome checks, finding maximum sums in subarrays, and solving the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.

6. Implementing various data structures, including stacks, queues, and binary trees, and performing operations such as traversals and minimum element retrieval.
